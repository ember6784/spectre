- **clean.md** lacks initial aggressive pattern detection; skips commented code, debug artifacts, and temporary logging that spotless_local explicitly targets (lines 96-118 in clean.md vs. exhaustive pattern list in spotless_local)
- **clean.md** requires explicit user scope (commit range or unstaged files); spotless_local auto-discovers working set and applies heuristics to prioritize high-risk areas, increasing discovery surface
- **clean.md** dispatches investigation subagents only after initial analysis; spotless_local begins with parallel subagent sweeps on chunked working set, catching more artifacts through concurrent review
- **clean.md** Step 4 (ESLint bypass planning) is purely diagnostic; spotless_local integrates ESLint analysis into the removal pipeline, surfacing tech debt as dead code candidates
- **clean.md** has weak confidence thresholds for "NEEDS_VALIDATION" vs "SAFE_TO_REMOVE"; spotless_local uses weighted risk scoring and conservative verdict gates, generating more removal tasks with higher confidence
- **clean.md** missing systematic search for: orphaned exports (no codebase-wide grep), test artifacts (.only/.skip), AI code slop patterns, and intentional duplication extraction recommendations that spotless_local includes

- Fixed ARGUMENTS tag from HTML entities to raw XML syntax (line 34) for proper input parsing
- Consolidated Steps 7-8 into single Step 6 merging cleanup summary generation, removal execution, and artifact commitment (lines 230-273)
- Moved ESLint compliance planning to Step 7 (lines 275-313) to run diagnostically after code cleanup rather than before investigation
- Added comprehensive success criteria checklist (lines 315-358) with 30 checkboxes across all 7 steps for validation and self-accountability
- Removed `naming_report.md` from file safety list (line 53) as naming audit was excluded per user preference
