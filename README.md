# SPECTRE

**S**cope → **P**lan → **E**xecute → **C**lean → **T**est → **R**ebase → **E**valuate

A structured workflow plugin for Claude Code. Provides consistent, reviewable AI-assisted development.

## Why SPECTRE?

AI coding agents are powerful but inconsistent. SPECTRE provides:

- **Structured workflow** — Each phase has clear inputs, outputs, and next steps
- **Parallel execution** — Subagents work concurrently for faster delivery
- **Session continuity** — Pick up where you left off across context limits
- **Built-in review** — Code review and validation at every stage

## Quick Start

### Claude Code

```bash
# Add marketplace and install
/plugin marketplace add Codename-Inc/spectre
/plugin install spectre@codename
```

Or add to your project's `.claude/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "codename": {
      "source": { "source": "github", "repo": "Codename-Inc/spectre" }
    }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "spectre@codename": true
  }
}
```

Then start building:
```
/spectre:scope "Add user authentication"
```

### Other Agents (Codex, Cursor, etc.)

Install the CLI:
```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/Codename-Inc/spectre.git
```

Use CLI commands to access SPECTRE capabilities:
```bash
# List available subagents
spectre subagent list

# Run a subagent
spectre subagent run dev "implement the login form"

# Get a command prompt
spectre command get /spectre:scope
```

## The SPECTRE Workflow

| Phase | Command | What It Does |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **S**cope | `/spectre:scope` | Define requirements, constraints, success criteria |
| **P**lan | `/spectre:plan` | Research codebase, create implementation plan |
| **E**xecute | `/spectre:execute` | Parallel implementation with wave-based delivery |
| **C**lean | `/spectre:clean` | Remove dead code, lint, format |
| **T**est | `/spectre:test` | Risk-aware test coverage |
| **R**ebase | `/spectre:rebase` | Safe merge preparation with conflict handling |
| **E**valuate | `/spectre:evaluate` | Document changes + architecture review |

Each command ends with "Next Steps" suggestions, so you always know what to do next.

## Session Memory

SPECTRE maintains context across sessions:

```
/spectre:handoff   # Save progress before session ends
/spectre:forget    # Clear memory for fresh start
```

Context automatically restores when you start a new session.

## Subagents

SPECTRE dispatches specialized subagents for different tasks:

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `@spectre:dev` | Implementation with MVP focus |
| `@spectre:analyst` | Understand how code works |
| `@spectre:finder` | Find where code lives |
| `@spectre:patterns` | Find reusable patterns |
| `@spectre:researcher` | Web research |
| `@spectre:tester` | Test automation |
| `@spectre:reviewer` | Independent code review |
