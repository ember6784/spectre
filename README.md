# SPECTRE

An agentic coding development workflow for Claude Code.

SPECTRE helps you get **consistent, high-quality results** from AI coding agents with **significantly less manual effort**. It encourages agents to work autonomously for longer while still delivering quality output.

## How It Works

SPECTRE guides AI agents through a structured workflow:

**S**cope → **P**lan → **E**xecute → **C**lean → **T**est → **R**ebase → **E**valuate

Every prompt includes "next steps" suggestions, so you don't need to memorize commands—just follow the flow.

> **Note**: SPECTRE creates `.claude/spectre/` in your project to store workflow reference files. Add `.claude/` to `.gitignore`.

## Quick Start: Pick Your Path

### 1. Standard Workflow (80% of tasks)

For most tasks, start with `/spectre:scope` and follow the prompts:

```
/scope → /plan → /execute → /clean → /test → /rebase → /evaluate
```

This is the recommended path for small, medium, and large tasks with manageable ambiguity.

### 2. Full Autonomous Mode

For tasks where you want to define scope interactively then let the agent run independently:

```
/spectre:spectre "Add user authentication"
```

This takes you through interactive scope definition, then completes the entire plan → execute → clean → test → rebase → evaluate flow autonomously.

### 3. Quick Dev (Small/Medium + More Control)

When you want tighter control over scope and plan before execution:

```
/spectre:quick_dev
```

Walks you through scope + plan interactively, then stops. Run `/execute` when ready.

## Handling High Ambiguity

If you're not ready for `/scope` yet, start earlier:

| Ambiguity Type | Start With | Then |
|----------------|------------|------|
| **Max ambiguity** (large feature, unclear requirements) | `/spectre:kickoff` | → `/scope` → ... |
| **Technical ambiguity** (how should this work?) | `/spectre:research` | → `/scope` → ... |
| **UX ambiguity** (what should we build?) | `/spectre:scope` | → `/plan` → ... |

These commands help you reduce ambiguity before committing to a plan.

## Session Memory

Keep your progress and context across Claude Code sessions.

### Setup
Turn off auto-compaction in Claude Code (`/config`) so you can control when to start fresh.

### Workflow
1. **End a session**: `/spectre:handoff` — saves progress, decisions, and todos
2. **Start a new session**: Context is automatically restored
3. **Clean slate**: `/spectre:forget` — archives memory for a fresh start

Your todos and progress summary appear at the start of each new session.
