# create_tasks: Unified Task Breakdown

Transform requirements into detailed, actionable task lists with dependency analysis and execution options. Adapts to context: uses existing research when sufficient, conducts research when needed. Outputs sequential and parallel execution strategies. Scales naturally to scope size.

## ARGUMENTS

&lt;ARGUMENTS&gt; $ARGUMENTS &lt;/ARGUMENTS&gt;

---

## Step 1: Establish Context

### 1a. Determine Output Location

- `TASK_DIR = user_specified || docs/tasks/{branch_name}`
- `mkdir -p "${TASK_DIR}/specs" "${TASK_DIR}/research" "${TASK_DIR}/clarifications"`

### 1b. Determine Depth

- Read `--depth` from ARGUMENTS: `light`, `standard` (default), or `comprehensive`
- Depth affects Implementation Approach detail level and task granularity

### 1c. Scan Artifacts

Inventory `TASK_DIR/`: task_summary.md, prd.md, ux.md, plan.md, task_context.md, research/\*.md + thread context, ARGUMENTS.

### 1d. Assess Complexity

**Simple** (no research): Single file, clear pattern, explicit scope | **Complex** (research needed): Multi-component, new patterns, unclear approach

---

## Step 2: Research Decision

### 2a. Need Research?

- **If** simple with clear scope → `NEED_RESEARCH=false`
- **If** complex or unclear → `NEED_RESEARCH=true`

### 2b. Have Research? (if needed)

Check artifacts for: codebase patterns, integration points, technical approach, target files.

- **If** sufficient coverage → `HAVE_RESEARCH=true`
- **If** gaps exist → `HAVE_RESEARCH=false` (note gaps)

### 2c. Action

- `NEED=false` → proceed to Step 3
- `NEED=true` AND `HAVE=true` → read existing, proceed to Step 3
- `NEED=true` AND `HAVE=false` → conduct research (2d)

### 2d. Conduct Research (conditional)

Spawn parallel: @codebase-locator, @codebase-analyzer, @codebase-pattern-finder Review: CLAUDE.md, README.md, architecture.md docs Save to `${TASK_DIR}/task_context.md` under "## Technical Research"

---

## Step 3: Extract Requirements

### 3a. Gather & Synthesize

Read all sources (task_summary, prd, plan, ux, thread, ARGUMENTS). Extract: what to build, users, success criteria, out of scope, constraints. Number: REQ-001, REQ-002. Categorize: Core, UX, Technical.

### 3b. Boundary Check

**Scope Litmus Test**: Would user recognize this as exactly what they asked? **STRICT**: Deliver ONLY what's explicitly stated. No optimizations, extra features, future-proofing unless requested.

---

## Step 4: Generate Tasks

### 4a. Implementation Approach (REQUIRED)

Before generating tasks, articulate **how** the pieces fit together. This section is always included in tasks.md output.

- **Action** — WriteImplementationApproach: Based on research and requirements, describe the approach:

  | Depth | Implementation Approach Content |
  | --- | --- |
  | **LIGHT** | 2-4 sentences: What pattern to follow, key file(s) to modify, how changes connect |
  | **STANDARD** | 1-2 paragraphs: Approach summary, integration points, key technical decisions, file references |
  | **COMPREHENSIVE** | References plan.md, summarizes phased approach, highlights critical path and dependencies |

  **Must answer**: What's the strategy? How do the changes fit together? What patterns/files are central?

### 4b. Synthesize Architecture Context

- **Action** — SynthesizeArchitectureContext: Document where work fits, technical approach, key decisions (with file references).

### Task Hierarchy

📦 **Phase** (organizational) → 📋 **Parent** (small-medium deliverable) → ✓ **Sub-task** (atomic, 2-3 criteria) → ✓ **Criteria** (verifiable outcomes)

**Numbering**: Phase 1 → 1.1, 1.2 → 1.1.1, 1.1.2 → ✓

### 4c. Create Parent Tasks

- **Action** — CreateParentTasks: Draft phases and parents (📋) covering complete scope. Each parent = cohesive deliverable.

### 4d. Break Down Sub-tasks

- **Action** — BreakdownSubTasks: For each parent, generate sub-tasks.
  - Format: Action verb + technical specifics + file names. Single focused change.
  - **Include**: Technical terms, patterns, integration points, file names, constraints
  - **Avoid**: Code snippets, function signatures, line-by-line steps
  - Criteria: 2-3 verifiable outcomes per sub-task. Split if 5+ criteria.

### 4e. Validate

- **Action** — VerifyCoverage: Map requirements to tasks. Flag gaps → add. Flag unjustified → remove.
- **Action** — ValidateTasks: Coverage, Exclusion (nothing beyond requests), Structure (hierarchy, atomic, verifiable)

---

## Step 5: Dependency Analysis & Execution

### 5a. Map Dependencies

Review parents (📋): output deps, file conflicts, type ordering (setup → work → tests).

### 5b. Sequential Execution

Step-by-step order: `1. Task 1.1 (no deps) → 2. Task 1.2 (depends on 1.1) → ...`

### 5c. Parallel Waves

Group independent parents: Wave 1 (no deps) → Wave 2 (depends on W1) → ... Include rationale.

---

## Step 6: Document & Output

### 6a. Write tasks.md

`TASKS_FILE = ${TASK_DIR}/specs/tasks.md` (use scoped name if exists)

**Sections**: Header → Objective → Scope (in/out) → **Implementation Approach** (REQUIRED - from 4a) → Requirements Traced (ID|Desc|Source|Tasks table) → Architecture Context (where fits, approach, decisions with file refs) → Tasks (Phase → Parent \[1.1\] → Sub-tasks with criteria) → Execution Strategies (sequential + parallel) → Coverage Summary

**Implementation Approach placement**: Immediately after Scope, before Requirements. This ensures the "how" is clear before diving into task details.

### 6b. Present Summary

- **Action** — SummarizeStructure: "Task Breakdown Complete. Structure: {X} phases, {Y} parents, {Z} sub-tasks. \[List phases with parent titles\]. Execution: Sequential ({N} steps) | Parallel ({M} waves). Saved to: {path}"
