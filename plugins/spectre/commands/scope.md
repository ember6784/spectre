# scope: Interactive Feature Scoping

Collaborative workflow for structuring unstructured thoughts into clear scope boundaries through contextual brainstorming and targeted clarifications. Focuses on user value and scope boundaries before technical considerations. Output: comprehensive scope document with clear boundaries, user value, and key decisions saved to `{OUT_DIR}/concepts/scope.md`.

## ARGUMENTS

&lt;ARGUMENTS&gt; $ARGUMENTS &lt;/ARGUMENTS&gt;

## Step 1: Immediate Reply & Gather Context

- **Action** — ImmediateReply: Respond before any tools.
  - **If** `FROM_KICKOFF=true` → acknowledge kickoff context, read `KICKOFF_DOC`, extract (Core Problem, User Value, Decisions Made, Remaining Ambiguities, Key Code Refs), **SKIP to Step 3**
  - **Else If** ARGUMENTS empty → probe for context enthusiastically
  - **Else** → proceed to Step 2
  - **CRITICAL**: No tool calls except reading kickoff doc when FROM_KICKOFF=true

## Step 2: Interactive Scope Exploration

**SKIP IF FROM_KICKOFF=true**

- **Action** — ExploreScope: Collaborative dialogue focused on boundaries and user experience.

  **CRITICAL**: Focus on WHAT, not HOW. Defer all technical/implementation questions until scope boundaries are finalized. Only ask technical questions if the scope itself is inherently technical (e.g., "migrate database from X to Y").

  **PATTERN**: Lead with a rich initial exploration. In your FIRST response, propose concrete hypotheses AND ask 5-8 questions across multiple dimensions. Give the user a full landscape to react to, not a single thread to follow.

  **FIRST RESPONSE FORMAT**:

  > Here's my initial read on this, plus questions to help us explore the bounds:
  >
  > **My hypothesis**: [problem statement, who it affects, proposed IN/OUT]
  >
  > **Questions to explore**:
  > 1. [User problem question]
  > 2. [UX flow question]
  > 3. [Boundary edge question]
  > 4. [Alternative approach question]
  > 5. [Success criteria question]
  > 6. [Edge case question]
  > ...
  >
  > Answer any/all that spark thoughts. Skip what's obvious.

  **Question types to include** (aim for 5-8 total, mix from these):

  - **User & Problem**: Who feels this most? What triggers the need? What's the cost of not solving it?
  - **UX & Feel**: Should this feel fast or thorough? Guided or flexible? What's the ideal flow?
  - **Boundaries**: What about [adjacent thing]—IN or OUT? If unlimited time, what else? What's essential for v1?
  - **Alternatives**: I could see this as [A] or [B]. Which direction?
  - **Edge cases**: What happens when [unusual situation]? Should we handle [error state]?
  - **Success**: What makes you say "this shipped well"? What's the one thing we can't get wrong?

  **DO NOT ask about**: implementation approach, technical trade-offs, architecture, or integration details until boundaries are confirmed.

- **Action** — IterateBoundaries: After user responds, refine boundaries and ask targeted follow-ups on gaps.

  > **Current Boundaries**: ✅ **IN**: \[list\] ❌ **OUT**: \[list\] ⚠️ **Unsure**: \[edge cases\]
  >
  > Any items to move? Add exclusions? Clarify edges? Reply 'looks good' to continue.

- **Wait** — User confirms Scope boundaries are accurate

## Step 3: Generate Targeted Clarifications

- **Action** — DetermineOutputDir:

  - **If** FROM_KICKOFF → use same dir as kickoff doc
  - **Else** → `OUT_DIR = user_specified || docs/tasks/{branch_name}`
  - `mkdir -p "$OUT_DIR"`

- **Action** — GenerateTargetedQuestions: Create 3-6 questions based ONLY on remaining scope ambiguities from Step 2 (or kickoff's "Remaining Ambiguities").

  **CRITICAL**: Only ask about unresolved scope ambiguities. Technical questions (architecture, trade-offs, integration) belong in `/spectre:plan`, not here.

- **Action** — SaveClarifications: Create `{OUT_DIR}/clarifications/scope_clarifications_{timestamp}.md`:

  - Header: concept name, confirmed boundaries so far
  - Questions: Each focused on a scope edge case with `<response></response>` block

- **Action** — PromptUser: "Saved clarifications to `{path}`. Answer in `<response>` blocks. Reply 'Read it' when ready."

- **Wait** — User replies

- **Action** — ReadClarifications: Read file, use responses (proceed with assumptions if empty)

## Step 4: Create Scope Document

- **Action** — CreateScopeDoc: Generate `{OUT_DIR}/concepts/scope.md` (use scoped filename if exists).

  **Priority**: User value and boundaries BEFORE technical details.

  **Sections**: The Problem (pain, impact, current state) → Target Users (primary, secondary, needs) → Success Criteria (outcomes, metrics) → User Experience (journeys, principles, trade-offs) → Scope Boundaries (in/out/maybe/future) → Constraints (platform, perf, a11y, scale) → Integration (touches, avoids, dependencies) → Decisions (from clarifications + rationale) → Risks (UX, scope creep, open questions) → Next Steps (`/spectre:plan` or `/spectre:create_tasks`, complexity S/M/L)

## Step 5: Light Technical Context (Optional)

**Only if scope identifies specific technical/architecture integration points.**

- **Action** — IdentifyTouchpoints: Identify desired areas of research, and dispatch parallel @analyst subagents to research each area. Surface-level only (component names, NOT implementation). List features this interacts with, constraints worth documenting, areas to avoid.

- **Action** — UpdateScopeDoc: Add findings to Integration & Constraints sections if relevant.

## Step 6: Final Review & Next Steps

- **Action** — PresentDocForReview: Show final boundaries and next steps together.

  > **Scope Complete**: `{OUT_DIR}/concepts/scope.md`
  >
  > **Final Boundaries**: ✅ **IN**: \[from doc\] ❌ **OUT**: \[from doc\] ⚠️ **Maybe/Future**: \[from doc\]
  >
  > Docs saved: `{OUT_DIR}/concepts/scope.md`, `{OUT_DIR}/clarifications/scope_clarifications_{timestamp}.md`
  >
  > Reply with any edits, updates, or clarifications — otherwise pick a next step:

- **Action** — RenderFooter: Render Next Steps using `@skill-spectre:spectre-guide` skill.

  > **NOTE**: Do NOT wait for explicit approval. Present next steps immediately inline with the review. User can reply with scope edits OR jump straight into a next step command. If user replies with edits, apply them to the scope doc and re-present.
