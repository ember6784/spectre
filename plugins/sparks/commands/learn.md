# /learn - Capture Project Knowledge

**Arguments provided**: $ARGUMENTS

---

<CRITICAL>
You MUST invoke the Skill tool to load `sparks-learn` before proceeding:

```
Skill({ skill: "sparks:sparks-learn" })
```

Do NOT interpret this command as already having the skill loaded. The skill is NOT expanded here — you must load it via the Skill tool.

If you proceed without invoking Skill(), you are NOT following instructions.
