# Build Progress

## Codebase Patterns
<!-- Patterns discovered during build -->
- `cli/` directory already existed with `__init__.py` and `build.py` - new subdirectories added alongside
- `plugins/spectre/` and `plugins/shared/` directories already existed (empty) - created in prior session
- `agents/` directory at repo root contains existing .md agent files (coder, analyzer, locator, etc.)
- `.gitignore` patterns `docs/` and `build/` require `-f` flag to add files in those paths

## Iteration — [1.1] Create Monorepo Directory Structure
**Status**: Complete
**What Was Done**: Created the monorepo directory structure for the unified CLI. Added cli/build/, cli/subagent/, cli/command/, cli/shared/ subdirectories with __init__.py files. Created templates/ directory with agent.md and command.md template files.
**Files Changed**:
- cli/build/__init__.py (new)
- cli/subagent/__init__.py (new)
- cli/command/__init__.py (new)
- cli/shared/__init__.py (new)
- templates/agent.md (new)
- templates/command.md (new)
- docs/active_tasks/main/specs/cli_migration_tasks.md (updated)
**Key Decisions**:
- Used `-f` flag to add files matching gitignore patterns (cli/build/, docs/)
- plugins/ and agents/ directories already existed, no action needed
**Blockers/Risks**: None

## Iteration — [1.2] Refactor build.py into cli/build/ Module
**Status**: Complete
**What Was Done**: Split the monolithic cli/build.py into a modular package structure. Created cli/build/stats.py (BuildStats class), cli/build/prompt.py (PROMPT_TEMPLATE and build_prompt), cli/build/stream.py (stream-json parsing), cli/build/loop.py (main build loop), and cli/build/cli.py (argument parsing). Updated __init__.py to export main entry point and public API.
**Files Changed**:
- cli/build/__init__.py (updated)
- cli/build/cli.py (new)
- cli/build/loop.py (new)
- cli/build/prompt.py (new)
- cli/build/stats.py (new)
- cli/build/stream.py (new)
- docs/active_tasks/main/specs/cli_migration_tasks.md (updated)
**Key Decisions**:
- Kept original cli/build.py intact (to be removed in Phase 6 cleanup after full validation)
- Used lazy import in __init__.py main() to avoid circular imports
- Entry point remains `cli.build:main` which works with new package structure
**Blockers/Risks**: None

## Iteration — [1.3] Move Plugin Assets to plugins/spectre/
**Status**: Complete
**What Was Done**: Moved commands/, agents/, and hooks/ directories from repo root to plugins/spectre/ using git mv to preserve history. Created plugins/spectre/plugin.json manifest with proper paths to commands, agents, and hooks. The hooks.json uses ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} which resolves correctly in the new location.
**Files Changed**:
- commands/ → plugins/spectre/commands/ (24 .md files)
- agents/ → plugins/spectre/agents/ (7 .md files)
- hooks/ → plugins/spectre/hooks/ (hooks.json + scripts/)
- plugins/spectre/plugin.json (new)
- docs/active_tasks/main/specs/cli_migration_tasks.md (updated)
**Key Decisions**:
- Used git mv to preserve commit history for moved files
- Plugin.json declares relative paths: "commands", "agents", "hooks/hooks.json"
- Hooks paths use ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} variable which resolves to plugin directory
**Blockers/Risks**: None

## Iteration — [2.1] Port Subagent Module
**Status**: Complete
**What Was Done**: Ported the complete subagent module from subspace-cli to spectre. Created cli/shared/discovery.py with unified agent and command discovery logic. Created cli/subagent/ with runner.py (sandbox execution), run.py, list.py, parallel.py, and show.py (Click commands). All references to "subspace" renamed to "spectre" and imports updated for new repo structure.
**Files Changed**:
- cli/shared/discovery.py (new - 500+ lines)
- cli/shared/__init__.py (updated - exports discovery functions)
- cli/subagent/runner.py (new - agent execution with sandbox)
- cli/subagent/run.py (new - single agent execution)
- cli/subagent/list.py (new - list available agents)
- cli/subagent/parallel.py (new - parallel agent execution)
- cli/subagent/show.py (new - show agent details)
- cli/subagent/__init__.py (updated - Click command group)
- docs/active_tasks/main/specs/cli_migration_tasks.md (updated)
**Key Decisions**:
- Combined agent and command discovery into single cli/shared/discovery.py (task 2.4 partial)
- Used Click instead of argparse for CLI (matching subspace-cli pattern)
- Renamed CODEX_HOME to CLAUDE_HOME and updated sandbox paths to .spectre/
- Using click.echo() for output instead of separate output.py module
**Blockers/Risks**: None

## Iteration — [2.2] Port Command Module
**Status**: Complete
**What Was Done**: Ported the command module from subspace-cli to spectre. Created cli/command/get.py (retrieve prompt text with argument interpolation), cli/command/list.py (list available commands), cli/command/show.py (show command details). Updated cli/command/__init__.py with Click command group. All commands use the shared discovery module created in task 2.1.
**Files Changed**:
- cli/command/get.py (new - retrieve command prompt)
- cli/command/list.py (new - list available commands)
- cli/command/show.py (new - show command details)
- cli/command/__init__.py (updated - Click command group)
- docs/active_tasks/main/specs/cli_migration_tasks.md (updated)
**Key Decisions**:
- Reused discovery logic from cli/shared/discovery.py (already had command discovery from task 2.1)
- Used click.echo() for output (consistent with subagent module)
- Supports namespaced commands (e.g., /spectre:scope) via subdirectory structure
**Blockers/Risks**: None

## Iteration — [2.3] Create Unified CLI Entry Point
**Status**: Complete
**What Was Done**: Created cli/main.py with Click command groups to unify all subcommands under the main `spectre` command. Root command includes --version flag, build subcommand with Click wrapper (delegates to existing argparse logic), subagent and command groups from their respective modules, and placeholder setup command. Updated pyproject.toml to add `spectre` entry point alongside existing `spectre-build` alias.
**Files Changed**:
- cli/main.py (new - unified CLI entry point)
- pyproject.toml (updated - added spectre entry point)
- docs/active_tasks/main/specs/cli_migration_tasks.md (updated)
**Key Decisions**:
- Used Click wrapper for build command to preserve existing argparse logic and interactive prompts
- Placeholder setup command returns exit(1) until task 3.1 implementation
- Both `spectre` and `spectre-build` entry points available for backwards compatibility
**Blockers/Risks**: None

## Iteration — [2.4] Create Shared Utilities Module
**Status**: Complete
**What Was Done**: Completed the shared utilities module by adding output.py (JSON, JSONL, text/table formatting) and config.py (configuration loading from files and environment variables). The discovery.py was already created in task 2.1. Updated __init__.py to export all new functions from these modules.
**Files Changed**:
- cli/shared/output.py (new - 200+ lines of output formatting utilities)
- cli/shared/config.py (new - 300+ lines of config management)
- cli/shared/__init__.py (updated - exports all new modules)
- docs/active_tasks/main/specs/cli_migration_tasks.md (updated)
**Key Decisions**:
- output.py provides format_json, format_table, output_jsonl, and error/warning utilities
- config.py uses simple YAML parsing (stdlib only, no PyYAML dependency)
- Configuration supports environment variable overrides (SPECTRE_*, CLAUDE_HOME, CODEX_HOME)
- Singleton pattern for global config access via get_config()
**Blockers/Risks**: None

## Iteration — [3.1] Implement spectre setup Command
**Status**: Complete
**What Was Done**: Created cli/setup.py with comprehensive setup functionality: plugin symlinking to ~/.claude/plugins/, agent symlinking to ~/.claude/agents/ with namespace prefixes (spectre:agent-name.md), and skill installation to both ~/.claude/skills/ and ~/.codex/skills/. Created skills/spectre_agent_tools/SKILL.md teaching Claude Code to recognize @agent and /command patterns and dispatch to spectre CLI. Updated cli/main.py to wire up the new setup module with --force, --skip-agents, and --skip-skill options.
**Files Changed**:
- cli/setup.py (new - 300+ lines of setup logic)
- cli/main.py (updated - wired up setup module)
- skills/spectre_agent_tools/SKILL.md (new - skill file for Claude/Codex)
- docs/active_tasks/main/specs/cli_migration_tasks.md (updated)
**Key Decisions**:
- Agents are symlinked individually with namespace prefix (spectre:coder.md) to allow merging with user's existing agents
- Skill is installed to both ~/.claude/skills/ and ~/.codex/skills/ for compatibility
- Setup is idempotent: re-running skips already-correct symlinks, --force overwrites
- Uses click.echo() for consistent output with rest of CLI
**Blockers/Risks**: None

## Iteration — [3.2] Update Skill File for Spectre
**Status**: Complete (already done in 3.1)
**What Was Done**: Verified that the skill file created in task 3.1 meets all 3.2 requirements. The SKILL.md at skills/spectre_agent_tools/SKILL.md already contains: pattern recognition for @agent-name syntax, pattern recognition for /command-name syntax, instructions referencing `spectre subagent run` and `spectre command get`, and examples using spectre commands.
**Files Changed**: None (skill file already complete)
**Key Decisions**:
- Task 3.2 was effectively completed as part of task 3.1 — the skill file was created with all required content
**Blockers/Risks**: None

## Iteration — [4.1] Update pyproject.toml
**Status**: Complete
**What Was Done**: Updated pyproject.toml for unified CLI. Updated description to reflect all CLI capabilities (build loop, subagent orchestration, slash commands, plugin setup). Added click>=8.0 as explicit dependency. Extended package discovery to include plugins* and skills* directories. Added package-data config to include .md and .json files.
**Files Changed**:
- pyproject.toml (updated - description, dependencies, package discovery, package-data)
- docs/active_tasks/main/specs/cli_migration_tasks.md (updated - marked 3.2 and 4.1 complete)
**Key Decisions**:
- click>=8.0 specified as explicit dependency (was implicitly required by CLI modules)
- Package discovery includes cli*, plugins*, skills* to capture all directories
- Package-data uses wildcard to include .md and .json across all packages
**Blockers/Risks**: None

## Iteration — [4.2] Update Installation & README
**Status**: Complete
**What Was Done**: Verified `pip install -e .` works correctly. Tested all CLI entry points (`spectre --help`, `spectre build --help`, `spectre subagent --help`, `spectre command --help`, `spectre setup --help`). Updated README.md with comprehensive CLI documentation including pip install instructions, build loop usage, subagent commands, slash command retrieval, and setup command examples.
**Files Changed**:
- README.md (updated - added Installation section with pip/source options, added full Spectre CLI section)
- docs/active_tasks/main/specs/cli_migration_tasks.md (updated - marked 4.2 complete)
**Key Decisions**:
- Renamed "Command Reference" section to "Slash Command Reference" to distinguish from CLI commands
- Added Team Setup section with settings.json example for auto-installing in projects
- Moved Installation section to top of file (before Quick Start) for better onboarding
**Blockers/Risks**: None
